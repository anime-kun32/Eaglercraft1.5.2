Thirty years ago,

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.040
a massive spacequake devastated the center of Eurasia,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.860
resulting in an incredible 150 million deaths.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.190
And now...

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.850
A dry wind blows

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.850
Dare mo ga utsumuku machi (Dead or Alive)

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.860

Utsuru no wa zetsubou dake

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.710
I scream out into nothingness.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.380
Please find me and make it stop!

Wake mo wakaranai mama ni

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.020
so I'm still wary of the kindness you show me.

Fureta yasashisa ga mada kowakute

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:44.730

April 10th

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.170
I'm being woken by my little sister in the most dreadful way possible.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.790
Kotori, my adorable little sister.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.760
What's wrong, my darling brother?

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.760
Get off of me! You're heavy!

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.730
Gouf!

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.900
You just said "Gouf!"

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.980
That's a mobile suit!

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.170
Hey! Why are you going back to sleep?

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.780
Wake up! Wake up, Onii-chan!

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.780
Wake up!

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.790
Run for it, Kotori.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.790
Huh?

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.880
I've got the "If you don't let me sleep for at least another 10 minutes,

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.290
I will tickle my little sister uncontrollably" virus.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.560
Also known as the T-virus.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.550
What?!

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.380
Run, Kotori... while I can still control myself!

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.180
B-But... What'll happen to you?!

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.430
Forget about me! As long as you're safe...

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.960
Quickly!

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.440
But then... Onii-chan!

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.950
Good grief.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.680
I'm so scared! The T-virus is gonna get me!

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.190
Calm down. I'm all right now.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.200
O-Onii-chan?

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.340
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.200
I'm your friend!

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.210
Early this morning, a small spacequake occurred on the outskirts of Tengu City.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.220
Only minor damage was done to the area, and there have been no reported injuries.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.220
Currently, there are still no explanations as to what is behind the spacequakes.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.340
Another one? It's nearby, too.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.220
Yeah.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.460
<i>Spacequakes.</i>

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.730
<i>Widespread disturbances of space of unknown origin.</i>

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.230
<i>As the name suggests, it's when a region of space shakes, destroying all within.</i>

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.360
<i>Nobody knows why they happen.</i>

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.890
<i>After the great disaster thirty years ago,</i>

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.330
<i>there were numerous spacequakes across the globe for the next six months.</i>

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.690
<i>Here in Japan, the one that leveled the area
which we live in now is the most well known.</i>

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.900
<i>The Great South Kanto Area Spacequake.</i>

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.250
<i>There were no more in the following 25 years,</i>

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:09.760
<i>but starting five years ago,
beginning in our reformed Tengu city,</i>

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.140
<i>the spacequakes have been on the rise.</i>

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.760
<i>To make things worse,</i>

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.120
<i>Japan's getting most of them.</i>

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.770
Haven't they been happening a lot lately?

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.520
Sure have.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.320
We might have to move up the schedule.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.110
Hey! We're about to have breakfast!

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:31.820
Jeez...

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.080
Make sure you eat all your breakfast, too.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.700
Of course!

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.330
I love you, Onii-chan!

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.340
Is there anything in particular you'd like for lunch?

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.340
Opening Ceremony

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.260
The Deluxe Kids' Lunch!

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.120
That's something you'd find at a diner.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.380
I'm sorry, but you won't find that here.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.480
What? But I want it!

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.010
Please! Please!

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.520
I'm begging you, Onii-chan!

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.790
Deluxe Kids' Lunch!

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.730
Having lunch at a diner!

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.000
It's nothing to be <i>that</i> happy about.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.320
I'm still happy. Thanks for taking me, Onii-chan.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.720
Let's meet up here when you get out of school, okay?

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.900
Got it.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.540
I mean it! You have to keep your promise!

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.540
Even if terrorists take over the restaurant, you'll still have to come!

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.550
If that happened, we wouldn't be eating at all.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.050
You made your point, so off to school with you.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.880
Isn't that Itsuka-kun?

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.530
Those two are way too touchy-feely.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.940
So he really <i>does</i> have a thing for his sister.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.310
Gross.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.190
It's definitely a promise!

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.930
You have to come even if there's a spacequake!

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.690
Yeah. I get it already, so get going.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.140
Good morning, Itsuka.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.720
Hey, Tonomachi.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.700
Glad to see you're starting the semester in top condition.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.290
Well, there's a rumor about him, too.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.740
They say Tonomachi swings both ways.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.450
Gross.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.840
What's wrong?

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.700
I think I just saw the super genius.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.340
Gross.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.100
But really, what a coincidence this is, Itsuka.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:32.110
Being in your class once again makes me believe that we are fated to be together.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.110
You think so?

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.890
Oh, excuse me. It's my girlfriend.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.130
Since when have you had a girlfriend?

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.370
Let me introduce you. Here.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.190
That's a dating sim!

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.050
A girlfriend is a girlfriend. Stop being so close-minded!

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:53.340
These games teach the user all one needs to know about interacting with women!

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.910
They're practically textbooks on dating.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.010
This "Fall in Love: My Little Seed" is real-time and is especiallyвЂ”

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:58.890
Itsuka Shido.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.380
Me?

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.020
Yes.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.330
Why do you know my name?

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:08.520
Don't you remember?

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.550
Hey, who is that?

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:22.110
You're telling me you don't know about Tobiichi Origami, the super genius?

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.290
Tobiichi...

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.420
Origami?

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:29.240
She's got the highest grades in our year, including P.E.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.400
And to top it off, she's a real beauty.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.430
She's always been one of the top three girls I'd like to date.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.600
To think you don't know about the most famous person in our school...

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.300
That said, why does Tobiichi know you?

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.490
That's what I'd like to know.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.160
Oh, it's Tama-chan!

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.200
Good morning!

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.260
I'll be your homeroom teacher for the year.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.910
My name is Okamine Tamae.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.170
<i>Tobiichi Origami.</i>

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.680
<i>Why do you know who I am?</i>

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.740
<i>Why are you looking at me?</i>

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.680
<i>What is it? What is it that you want from me?!</i>

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.740
Itsuka, let's go home together.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.690
Sorry, I've already got plans.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.640
Oh? With a girl?

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.370
You could say that. Just Kotori, though.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.740
I know.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.220
From my investigations,

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.700
I've concluded that no girl would ever agree to have lunch with you.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.000
That's going too far.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.960
A spacequake has been detected in the area.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:50.960
A spacequake warning?

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.200
There's a quake coming?

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:59.680
This is not a drill. Please evacuate to your nearest shelter. I repeat: a spacequakeвЂ”

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.710
Let's find shelter. We should be fine in the school's bunker.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.800
<i>Tobiichi?</i>

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.200
"Contriella aura avu yutorimme skalv."

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.740
"Intensitetto folto shigelsa tori conma fein."

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.270
"Monsto matchinihi Princess!"

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.070
It's here.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:20.570
I repeat: a spacequake has been detected in the area.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.570
SPACEQUAKE ALERT

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.570
ANNOUNCEMENT

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:26.760
This is not a drill. Please evacuate to your nearest shelter.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.080
I repeat: a spacequake has been detected in the area.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:35.200
Calm down, everyone! Don't forget the three S's! Single file, steady line, skeletons!

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.050
Miss, <i>you</i> need to calm down.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.800
Y-Y-You're right.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:42.960
<i>I hope Kotori managed to find shelter, too.</i>

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.800
<i>Please don't tell me she was serious about the promise.</i>

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.350
You have to come even if there's a spacequake!

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.450
<i>You're not waiting in front of the diner, are you?</i>

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.720
<i>You went to the nearest shelter, right?</i>

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.730
<i>Calm down. She just can't hear her
phone because the shelter's so noisy.</i>

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.380
<i>That must be it.</i>

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.420
<i>I should check her GPS location, just in case.</i>

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.870
<i>Just to make sure. Just to make sure she's not...</i>

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:12.500
Hey, Itsuka!

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.010
I love you, Onii-chan!

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:23.760
<i>Why?!</i>

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.010
Thanks, Onii-chan!

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.010
<i>Why?!</i>

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:33.540
<i>Why are you waiting for me when the whole city's shut down?!</i>

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.980
<i>Kotori, Kotori, Kotori!</i>

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.450
Wh-What the...

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:20.480
<i>What's she doing down there?</i>

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:31.750
You, too?

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.810
You're here to kill me, too?

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.080
You're here to kill me, aren't you?

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.440
If that's the case, I will finish you here and now.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.560
W-Wait! Hold on!

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.080
There is no way I'd do that!

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.830
What?

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.180
I'd never kill someone.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.460
Who are you, anyway?

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.610
Why won't you realize the futility of it all?

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.870
<i>Why is this girl...</i>

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:07.640
<i>She has such strength... but looks so despondent.</i>

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.250
Tobiichi Origami?

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.760
Itsuka Shido?

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.760
Wh-What the heck are you wearing?

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.560
Location: FJ-1820.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.320
Target: Princess.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.300
Target lost.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.920
Insufficient readings to continue tracking.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:37.480
Huh?

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.630
What?

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.310
Target is lost.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.820
It's been a while.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.820
At last, we meet again.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.140
Who are you?

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.430
I'm so happy.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:51.820
But please, just wait a little longer.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:57.880
I will never let you go. I won't ever make a mistake again.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:59.960
So...

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:10.720
Looks like you're awake.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.800
Wh-Who are you?

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:17.200
I am the analysis officer here, Murasame Reine.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:22.310
No need to worry. I may not be a doctor, but I can take care of basic nursing.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.060
<i>That not exactly what I want to hear.</i>

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:31.330
Um, would you mind telling me where I am?

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.690
Fraxinus' sickbay.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.570
We brought you here while you were unconscious.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:40.100
Fraxi... Unconscious...?

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.340
Ah, that's right. I got caught in the middle of a battle.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.020
Kotori!

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.520
My little sister! I'm looking for my little sister!

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.840
She was outside a diner and not in a shelter. And then...

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.820
Calm down.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.540
She's fine.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.800
Huh? What?

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.730
I know there are plenty of things you would like to know,

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.350
but I'm not the person who can explain them to you.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.850
The commander will answer any questions you have.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.850
He's here.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.210
Thank you.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:17.640
Hello there. I'm the vice commander, Kannazuki Kyouhei.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.240
Pleased to meet you.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.620
Kotori?

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:34.400
Welcome aboard. I welcome you to my command center, the Ratatoskr.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.890
Angle of approach, clear. Activate ANS.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:47.890
Disconnect.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.810
Good work, Origami.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:56.400
Captain Kusakabe...

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.410
You need to take better care of yourself.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:05.580
These things are called Spirits, which we just lost.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.260
In other words, she disappeared.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:07.970
And this isвЂ”

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.660
H-Hold a second!

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:10.990
What now?

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:14.170
You're already making the commander give you a personal explanation.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.800
You should be shedding tears of joy for such an honor.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.890
For now, I'll give you the privilege of licking my feet.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:22.260
R-Really?!

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.550
Not you!

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.060
Th-Thank you!

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:29.300
You <i>are</i> Kotori, right?

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:33.060
What's this? Have you forgotten the face of your own little sister, Shido?

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.140
What'd you just call me?!

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.820
I knew you had an awful memory,
but I never thought it was <i>that</i> bad.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.220
Maybe I should already be looking for a retirement home for you.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.660
What are you doing here? And where are we?

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.570
And also

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:48.540
Yes, yes. We'll fill you in on all the details later,

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.080
but for now, I want you to understand this.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.360
First of all, she is a Spirit.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.250
They are beings who did not originally exist in this world.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.090
Upon coming here, they can't help but blow the area up.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.630
Blow it up?

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.220
Not very bright, are you?

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.900
In other words, the phenomenon referred to as spacequakes

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.170
are caused by Spirits like this one coming to Earth.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:10.850
What

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.520
<i>She... did that?</i>

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:21.330
Second, these are the AST.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:23.860
They're the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force's Anti-spirit Team.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.550
If a Spirit appears, these guys fly over and deal with the situation.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.120
Basically, they slaughter them.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.080
S-Slaughter?!

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.080
You're here to kill me, too?

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:41.240
Third, there is another method of dealing with the Spirits, apart from the AST.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.690
However, it requires your help.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:45.640
My help?

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.260
You'll begin training tomorrow.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:53.630
I'll have someone do the paperwork for you, but for now, you should go to school likeвЂ”

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.160
H-Hold up!

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.530
What is this "training"?

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.900
And what are you planning to make me do?

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.440
I didn't ask for your input.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.070
I'll take nothing other than "Yes," from you.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.810
I know you're an idiot, but why were you outside?

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.180
Got a death wish?

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.290
I was looking for <i>you!</i>

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:18.040
You're the one who said I'd have to come even if there was a spacequake!

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.010
Sure, I said that, but you must be some kind of blockhead to actually take it seriously.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:23.360
Of course I did!

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.510
Your cellphone wasn't moving from outside the diner!

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.100
My cellphone?

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.500
Ah, I should've known.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.600
We're directly above that diner.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.440
Huh?

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.770
Turn the filter off.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:41.270
We're currently 15,000 meters above Tengu City.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.050
We're inside the airship Fraxinus.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.770
The Following Day

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.770
Um, although it's only been two days since the term started,

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.980
we'll be having a new assistant homeroom teacher with us.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:23.780
I'm Murasame Reine.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:26.500
I teach Physics.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.670
Nice to met

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.040
Physics preparation room

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.250
Why are you suddenly a teacher here?

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:40.880
What's going on, analysis officer Murasame?

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.770
Just call me Reine, Shintarou.

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:46.130
No, my name is Shido.

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:49.680
I see. My bad, Shin.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.440
Are you even <i>trying</i> to get it right?!

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.570
But that's not the point here.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:57.680
I'll be able to reach you quickly in case anything happens.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.440
You could've figured that out if you used your head a little,

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.190
you lowly stinkbug.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.960
Never mind that. What are <i>you</i> doing here?

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.130
What happened to going to school?

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.410
I made the proper arrangements.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:16.050
So... will you finally explain what you're planning to make me do?

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.450
Once you've used this training software, you'll soon understand.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:20.540
Reine.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.260
A-A dating sim?

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.970
This looks just like the one Tonomachi played.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.490
It isn't the same!

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:37.470
Take a closer look.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:43.980
"My Little Shido?"

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.540
Special Disaster-causing Organisms

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.560
residing between worlds.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:58.300
Origin and reason for existence are both unknown.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.200
Upon appearing in this world,

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.720
they trigger spacequakes,

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:07.120
causing immense damage in the area.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:10.270
Countermeasure:

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:14.260
extermination with weapons.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:21.660
However, this is extremely difficult due to their advanced combat capabilities.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.050
Good morning, Onii-tan!

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:24.840
It's me, Ririko!

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.810
Looks like things are going downhill.

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:28.460
But I know that you'll sort it all out!

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.140
I'm sure you can do it!

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:30.910
Hey, Shido,

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.740
you wouldn't want to hurt or kill the Spirits, would you?

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.870
But if you let them be, they'll cause more spacequakes.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.130
Why don't we persuade them, then?

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.060
They need to like this world.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.370
You know what they say, "The world looks much better when you're in love."

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.000
Which means, Itsuka-kun...

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.360
Which means...

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.340
Which means...

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:52.760
You have to

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.300
date her, date her!

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.730
Make the Spirits fall for you!

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.980
With friendly chatting...

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.850
...lovey-dovey dates...

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:02.770
...and your utmost charm!

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.100
That's Shido-kun's...

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.940
Itsuka-kun's...

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.280
Onii-tan's...

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.690
...mission!

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:13.850
There you have it!

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:15.560
Good luck with your training!

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.900
You saw me yesterday.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:25.500
Yeah.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.090
Don't tell anyone.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:32.510
As a matter of fact, you should forget everything you saw yesterday.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.010
About that girl, too?

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.880
Tell me, Tobiichi. Is that girl...

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.700
She's a Spirit.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.020
Something I must defeat at all costs.

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:50.020
Are they really that bad?

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:57.530
It was a Spirit's fault that five years ago my parents...

00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:59.530
died.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:07.330
Before the world ends, kill me or kiss me.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:07.330
Sekai ga owaru mae ni kill or kiss

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:13.960
I don't know a thing about love,

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:13.960
Mada koi no "ko" no ji mo shiranai no ni

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:19.800
so I can't believe I got into a relationship without any kind of tutorial.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:19.800
Aa doushite tutorial mo naku jissen

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:25.470
My feelings make me get ahead of myself all the time.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:25.470
Kimochi dake flying shite saizensen

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:30.190
And every time you act aloof, I get into a panic.

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:30.190
Kuuru na kimi hajikare panikku

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:36.940
I'm struggling to figure out how much you love me.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:36.940
Koukando no nami ni furimawasarete

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:43.080
Maybe I'm getting toyed with, or maybe even worse than that.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:43.080
Asobareteru omocha mocha sore ika

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.120
It's long way

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:52.790
I'll keep running at full speed

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:52.790
Hateshinasugiru kimi e no michinori wo

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:58.510
along the endless road leading to you.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:58.510
zensokuryoku de hashiri tsuzukeruyo
